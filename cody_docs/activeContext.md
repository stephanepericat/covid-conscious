## What We're Working On Now

Right now, we are working on rebuilding the UI using the ShadCN library. In particular, we are focused on rebuilding the filtering functionality in the various list pages.

## Recent Changes

We started working on the new filter panel for list pages, which will contain topic-relevant filters allowing users to easily find the information they are looking for.

## Next Steps

We need to figure out how to make dynamic queries against the Sanity CMS when filters are applied.
